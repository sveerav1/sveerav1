Holding a Master of Science in Information Systems Engineering from Binghamton University, I specialize in Software engineering and data analysis, driven by a passion for data innovation. My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in database design, data modeling, and advanced data concepts, complemented by practical experience in design patterns. I possess hands-on expertise in AWS and GCP, with additional knowledge in data mining and applied machine learning.

Professionally, I have worked as a Software Engineer at Jocata Financial Technology, where I led the development of a Digital Lending Platform leveraging microservices architecture. This experience allowed me to streamline loan procedures, enhance operational efficiency, and significantly improve customer experience. I also developed web applications, managed big data, and automated data processes, resulting in optimized release metrics analysis and accelerated data-driven decisions.

My technical skills include proficiency in Java, Python, SQL, JavaScript, and various frameworks such as Spring, Spring Boot, and Hibernate. I am adept at using tools and technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring efficient and scalable solutions. I have experience with databases including Oracle, MySQL, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, and have implemented robust data migration and integration solutions.

In my academic projects, I have engineered machine learning models and topic modeling algorithms, demonstrating my ability to handle complex datasets and derive meaningful insights. I have also contributed to the analysis of shielding effectiveness of Faraday cages for high voltage laboratories, showcasing my research capabilities.

I am eager to collaborate with innovative companies to apply my expertise in data engineering and analysis. I am actively seeking a full-time role where I can grow professionally, tackle new challenges, and contribute to data-driven solutions. I believe in continuous learning and am open to relocation, ready to bring my skills to a dynamic and challenging environment.
